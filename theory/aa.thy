(* 子目标2 *)
lemma subgoal2:

  shows "False"
proof -
  (* 从子目标1得知，如果上述条件成立，则 n < 3 *)
  from subgoal1 assms(1,2,3,4,5,6) have "n < 3" .
  
  (* 分析 bit 56 n *)
  have "bit 56 n = (n = 56)"
    by (simp add: bit_def)
  
  from `n < 3` have "n \<noteq> 56" by auto
  hence "bit 56 n = False"
    by (simp add: bit_def)
  
  from assms(7) have "bit 56 n" .
  
  thus "False" using `bit 56 n = False` by simp
